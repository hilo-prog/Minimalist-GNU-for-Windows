## Introduction

MinGW is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications. It provides a complete GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) toolchain, which includes essential tools for compiling and linking programs. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, MinGW offers a straightforward way to get started with programming on Windows.

## Installation

To install MinGW, you can download the latest version from the [Releases section](https://github.com/hilo-prog/Minimalist-GNU-for-Windows/releases). After downloading, execute the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to set up the environment. 

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/hilo-prog/Minimalist-GNU-for-Windows/releases).
2. Download the installer file.
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using MinGW to compile your programs. Open your command prompt and navigate to the directory where your source code is located. Use the following command to compile a C program:

```bash
gcc your_program.c -o your_program.exe
```

Replace `your_program.c` with the name of your source file. This command will create an executable file named `your_program.exe` in the same directory.

To run your program, simply type:

```bash
./your_program.exe
```

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: MinGW allows you to write code on Windows and run it on other platforms.
- **Lightweight**: The MinGW installation is compact and does not require extensive system resources.
- **Easy to Use**: The simple command-line interface makes it easy to compile and run programs.
